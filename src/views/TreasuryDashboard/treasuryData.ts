  rfv: t`Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing EXOD.`,
  pol: t`Protocol Owned Liquidity, is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.`,
  holder: t`Holders, represents the total number of Exodians (sEXOD holders)`,
  staked: t`Staked supply is the percentage of circulating EXOD tokens which are currently staked.`,
  backing: t`Backing is the dollar value of assets from the treasury backing a single EXOD.`,
  supply: t`Supply (Circulating/Total) represents the circulating and total amount of EXOD in existence. The circulating supply includes all staked EXOD, wsEXOD and EXOD in liquidity pools while the total also includes EXOD in the DAO treasury.`,

  runway: t`Runway, is the number of days sEXOD emissions can be sustained at a given rate. Lower APY = longer runway`,
  dilution: t`Dilution, is the ratio between index growth and total supply growth. It indicates how much stakers have been diluted. Slower decline is better.`,
  minted: t`EXOD Minted, is the number of EXOD minted each day from bonds`,
  mcs: t`EXOD minted/Total Supply, is the number of EXOD minted from bonds over total supply of EXOD.`,
  debtratio: t`Debt ratio, is a metric that tells you how much EXOD is currently vesting in relation to the total EXOD supply. The numbers dont reflect the actual values, but, it can be used to form an impression of how much EXOD is being minted from bonding in relation to the total supply.`,
  indexAdjustedPrice: t`Index adjusted price is the market price of EXOD times the index.`,
